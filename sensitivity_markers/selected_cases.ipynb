It is used to refer to the cultures of different populations in the context of different regions; its usage is often contradictory from region to region. It refers to the culture and styles produced by white people who had Spanish parents and were born in the Spanish territories of North and South America in the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries; their culture and social position were distinguished from residents who had been born in Spain. In modern usage in the context of Latin America, it may refer to the culture of people born locally but of pure Spanish extraction or specifically to traditions of old-line families of predominantly Spanish descent. The term may also refer to the culture of early South American blacks born in America, as distinguished from blacks brought directly from Africa. In Louisiana in the United States it refers to the culture of either French-speaking white descendants of early French and Spanish settlers or of mulattos speaking a form of French and Spanish patois.  It may also refer to the culture of people in the West Indies who were born and naturalized there, but were of Spanish, French, or African descent; in modern usage in the context of the Caribbean, it is often used to refer to Caribbean culture in general, including elements from European, African, Asian, and Amerindian sources.\n",

The aboriginal Australians named Diyari constructed these innovative signposts at the Lutheran Mission at Killalpaninna between 1903 and 1906. Toas are not a traditional form of sculpture; it is believed that the production of toas was by the request of Europeans interested in aboriginal culture.

      "aboriginals 300438772 Cultures and styles of the Amis people lived in Taiwan. The Amis people refer to themselves in two ways: Pangcah meaning “we people” is used in regions north of Taitung, and Amis meaning “northerners” is used in the south. The denomination has to do with routes of migration and interaction among tribes. The Chinese term came to adapt Amis. The Amis territory stretches from the Qilai plain to the Hengchun peninsula, where the Amis people develop an agrarian culture intricately rooted in the low lands of Taiwan’s eastern valley and coastal plains. The Amis has the largest population of aboriginals in Taiwan.There are three subcategories of the Amis people based on geographical and cultural-linguistic differences: The Northern group of “Nanshi” Amis, the Middle group of “Xiuguluan” Amis and coastal Amis, and the Southern group of “Falangaw” Amis and Hengchun Amis.The property inheritance of the Amis is matrilineal and traditional matrimony follows the rule of mikadafo which marries Amis men into the brides’ homes. The Amis tribe is co-governed by clan chiefs, who assign responsibilities and tasks to male members of different age classes. The Harvest Festival, known as Malalikid, is the most important celebration which unifies traditional beliefs, social structure and tribal identity.\n",
      "barbarian 300018409 Refers to the Chinese dynastic culture, style, and period dating 386 to 534 CE. Its capital was initially at Pingcheng but was moved south to Luoyang in 493-494 by Emperor Xiaowendi (reigned 471-499) where a new magnificent city was built on the ruins of the old Chinese capital; by 534 the population was more than half a million. Buddhist art flourished under state and private patronage during most of this period. Cave temples at Yungang were begun in ca. 460; thousands of craftsmen worked for about 35 years to make the temples and adorn them with sculpture and painting. Other cave temples were later made at Longmen at the instigation of Xiaowendi. While Yungang features static icons in a Gandharan style, the sculpture at Longmen is more linear, demonstrating the emerging Chinese style. Northern Wei burial pottery, also influenced by Buddhism, emphasizes frontality and symmetry. The nomadic Touba people began to rely on Chinese institutions to organize and run their state and they also became accustomed to Chinese culture and luxuries; under Xiaowendi Chinese became the official language and the use of Tuoba language was forbidden. The distinction between the 'barbarian' north and 'civilized' south became less marked; nevertheless, northern frontiersmen began to feel neglected and so they revolted, leading to the collapse of the Northern Wei dynasty. Northern China was divided into the Eastern and Western Wei dynasties in 534.\n",

      "oriental 300021521 Refers to the art and culture associated with the Islamic dynasty of this name that was founded in 750, when it overthrew the Umayyad caliphate. The Abbasids were a Meccan family descended from Abbas, Muhammad's uncle. Their headquarters were in Mesopotamia and they founded the city of Baghdad in 762.  Persian ideas prevailed during this period and the Abbasids ruled in great splendor as Oriental monarchs. Encouraging intense intellectual and artistic activity, many palaces and mosques were built and the production of luxury items became an industry. A unified style of art developed, inspired by ancient Persia rather than Christian Syria. The ruined city of Samarra, occupied by the Abbasids in the 9th century, is a prime example of this influence, especially in the Sassanian construction methods. Samarra is noted for its ornamental stucco, particularly the so-called 'bevelled' manner of decoration derived from Scythian-Siberian abstract design. Highly valued Chinese porcelain was imitated by potters of the period; the results were distinctly Islamic, however, with Arabic inscriptions and designs. Abbasid textiles also assumed an identifiable Islamic character. The vast empire became unwieldy and as its central administration weakened, rival caliphates were established. Although the Abbasids continued to rule part of the Islamic world until 1258, their dominance only lasted until the mid-10th century.\n",

      "white 300264340 An eclectic Islamic dervish order that originated in the 12th century with an Anatolian dervish named Hadjdji Bektash, about whom little is known. It was given definitive form in the 16th century in Anatolia (Turkey) by Bālim Sulṭān. While originally a Sufi order within Orthodox Sunnite Islam, during this period it became more syncretic and adopted tenets of the Shi'a sect. Aspects of Christianity such as confession, absolution and initiation practices were also incorporated as a result of contact with Christians. Bektashi is Shi'a in that it recognizes the twelve imāms (spiritual leaders) and venerates Ali but it is different from most other Muslim orders in that it regards traditional Islamic rituals as hypocrisy and, like many Sufi orders, is lax about observing daily Muslim laws. Bektashi allows women to take part in rituals without wearing a veil. Bektashi mystical writings are an important contribution to Sufi poetry. Through its connection with the Janissaries, an elite Ottoman military corp recruited from Christian areas, Bektashi maintained political importance from the 15th century until shortly after 1826 when the Janissaries were disbanded. The Bektashi order was dissolved in Turkey in 1925 along with all other Sufi orders but it survived in Albania until religion was banned there in 1967. It is still found in some communities in Turkey, Albanian regions of the Balkans, and the United States. Followers wear white caps with 4 or 12 folds, the 4 representing the 4 gates of Islam and the 12 representing the 12 imāms.\n",
