Buddhism continued to have a large impact on the arts, with Indian, Central Asian, and West Asian influences. Northern Qi cave temples are home to some of the finest Chinese Buddhist sculpture. This sculpture illustrates the productivity of the period as well as the fast evolution of style that occurred since the Northern Wei. Some massive, sculptural ceramic forms date from the Northern Qi. Two or more colored glazes were applied to Northern Qi ceramics and white-bodied wares were developed. The wall paintings in the tomb of the aristocrat Lou Rui at Taiyuan are examples of the high-quality painting produced during this time. The rule of Gao Yang was followed by the rule of tyrants who conscripted almost two million men to build the Great Wall.

The main drum and flute of the two types differ, and komagaku does not involve stringed instruments. The term kangen refers to purely instrumental performances of gagaku while bugaku ('dance music') refers to the music performed with accompanying ceremonial dance. Some aspects of accompanying Shinto ritual and ancient vocals have remained; most of the solo music for the gagaku instruments has been lost although some notations have survived.

The Gupta period saw an outpouring of science, visual art, music, and literature, and had its zenith during the reign of Chandra Gupta II (375-415 CE). Some of India's earliest surviving paintings were created during this period at the Buddhist caves at Ajanta in the Deccan; the paintings are characterized by lively calligraphic line and life-like, contemporary details. The renowned Gupta sculptural style probably grew out of the Kushan style; by the end of the 4th century a distinctive Buddha icon had developed, characterized by monumental simplicity and refined realism. The tension of earlier Mathuran sculpture has been replaced by a calm and tranquil mood connoting a spiritual other worldliness that is a hallmark of the Gupta Buddhist style. The many sculptural finds at Sarnath include a group of sculptures known as the 'wet Buddhas' in which clinging drapery and webbed fingers are distinguishing Gupta features. During this period, Hindu art emerged into prominence; the earliest and most dramatic example of Gupta Hindu art is the rock-cut shrine at Udayagiri of 401. The sculptor of the reliefs of the ruined Dashavatara Temple at Deogarh took the Buddhist style of Sarnath and applied it to a Hindu motif with striking results.

China flourished as a stable, consolidated empire and the resulting prosperity and patronage created a Golden Age of Chinese painting, metalwork, ceramics, music, and poetry. Chang'an, with its masterful urban planning, remained the main Tang capital and a world center. Taizong (reigned 626-649) and Xuanzong (reigned 712-756) were important Tang rulers and patrons. Buddhism remained influential although it suffered periods of persecution during the Tang dynasty. Paintings from the caves at Dunhuang and stone pagodas such as the Great Wild Goose Pagoda (ca. 652) and the Small Wild Goose Pagoda (ca. 707) in Chang'an have survived. Monumental stone sculpture of the northern provinces displays the new tendency toward fuller, more sensual figures. This tendency also found in secular Tang sculpture, both stone and ceramic. The merging of Indian and Chinese sculpture styles is seen at the cave at Mt. Tianlong, created under the patronage of Empress Wu Zetian (reigned 690-705). Painting, which flourished during the Tang, was dominated by the secular landscape tradition. Li Sixum and Li Zhaodao, father and son, and Wang Wei are three painters' names known to us; probable copies of their work exist. Wang Wei's work, influential for later artists, was intimate and melancholy while the work of Li Sixum and Li Zhaodao features the bright greens and blues of many Tang landscapes. Chinese portrait painting, begun in the Han dynasty, was refined in the Tang by such artists as Wu Daozi. Tang ceramics include sancai earthenware figurines and vessels, typically used as tomb objects, white porcellanous wares such as the well-known Xing ware of Henan province, and the jadelike Yue celadons of Zhejiang province. The use of metal oxides in underglaze decoration was developed in Hunan and Sichuanh provinces and porcelain, although not fully exploited until later, has its origins in the Tang period. Tang decorative arts were influenced by Middle Eastern and other foreign trends during the Tang dynasty, leading to new styles in ceramics and metalwork. For instance, colorful glazed earthenware objects such as ewers and rhytons were made to resemble Persian silverwork and Persian weft patterning were introduced to Chinese textiles. China, in turn, exported its pottery, silk, and printing and paper technology.

Bektashi allows women to take part in rituals without wearing a veil. Bektashi mystical writings are an important contribution to Sufi poetry. Through its connection with the Janissaries, an elite Ottoman military corp recruited from Christian areas, Bektashi maintained political importance from the 15th century until shortly after 1826 when the Janissaries were disbanded.

It has large fruits containing a mealy substance that can be used for making bread and fermented drinks. In ancient times the fruits were an article of food among the poor, and a wine made from the fruit was thought to produce contentment and forgetfulness, as described in Homer. This is also probably the lotus mentioned in the Biblical Book of Job, where a large hippopotamus-like creature (behemoth) lies under the lotus tree.

There are several Zirid buildings in Granada, including a palace (1052-6) on the site of the Alhambra erected by Yusuf ibn Naghrallah, the Zirid's Jewish vizier. The only remains of this splendid palace are 12 white marble lions, reused in the 14th century for the central fountain in the Palace of the Lions. Zirid patrons also furnished religious buildings; for example, a carved wooden minbar was given in 980 by the Zirid ruler Buluggin to the mosque of the Andalusians in Fez. The most important example of Zirid woodwork is the heavily carved maqsura ordered by al-Mu'izz ibn Badis for the congregational mosque at Kairouan; a carved inscription is outlined by a distinctively Zirid raised bead.

China flourished as a stable, consolidated empire and the resulting prosperity and patronage created a Golden Age of Chinese painting, metalwork, ceramics, music, and poetry. Chang'an, with its masterful urban planning, remained the main Tang capital and a world center. Taizong (reigned 626-649) and Xuanzong (reigned 712-756) were important Tang rulers and patrons. Buddhism remained influential although it suffered periods of persecution during the Tang dynasty. Paintings from the caves at Dunhuang and stone pagodas such as the Great Wild Goose Pagoda (ca. 652) and the Small Wild Goose Pagoda (ca. 707) in Chang'an have survived. Monumental stone sculpture of the northern provinces displays the new tendency toward fuller, more sensual figures. This tendency also found in secular Tang sculpture, both stone and ceramic. The merging of Indian and Chinese sculpture styles is seen at the cave at Mt. Tianlong, created under the patronage of Empress Wu Zetian (reigned 690-705). Painting, which flourished during the Tang, was dominated by the secular landscape tradition. Li Sixum and Li Zhaodao, father and son, and Wang Wei are three painters' names known to us; probable copies of their work exist. Wang Wei's work, influential for later artists, was intimate and melancholy while the work of Li Sixum and Li Zhaodao features the bright greens and blues of many Tang landscapes. Chinese portrait painting, begun in the Han dynasty, was refined in the Tang by such artists as Wu Daozi. Tang ceramics include sancai earthenware figurines and vessels, typically used as tomb objects, white porcellanous wares such as the well-known Xing ware of Henan province, and the jadelike Yue celadons of Zhejiang province. The use of metal oxides in underglaze decoration was developed in Hunan and Sichuanh provinces and porcelain, although not fully exploited until later, has its origins in the Tang period. Tang decorative arts were influenced by Middle Eastern and other foreign trends during the Tang dynasty, leading to new styles in ceramics and metalwork. For instance, colorful glazed earthenware objects such as ewers and rhytons were made to resemble Persian silverwork and Persian weft patterning were introduced to Chinese textiles. China, in turn, exported its pottery, silk, and printing and paper technology.

While not great patrons of the arts, by reuniting China, expanding trade, and by not imposing stylistic demands, different traditions and influences were brought together and freely used. Innovations occurred particularly in the applied arts of porcelain and lacquer. During this time the Silk Route was reopened and Europe's interest in China began to develop. In response to foreign domination, educated Chinese withdrew into tradtions of their native past, with many scholars rejecting government service. The school of literati painting became dominant in the realm of painting, with artists emphasizing individual and calligraphic expression in contrast to the decorativeness of official painting. The most important Yuan masters were Huang Gongwang, Wu Zhen, Ni Zan, and Wang Meng, all of whom were literati objectors to Mongol rule. A noteworthy exception was Zhao Mengu, the most important Y\u00fcan calligrapher, who served the Mongols and was president of the Hanlin Academy. In the realm of ceramics, Middle Eastern influence stimulated exuberant blue-and-white decoration; Middle Eastern merchants also commissioned enormous Longquan celadons.

Buddhism, which came to China from neighboring India, had the most profound effect on Six Dynasties art; by the fourth century there was an established category of Chinese Buddhist art. The monastery at Dunhuang in western China preserves notable wall paintings. Monumental sculpture, a tradition brought to China from northern India, became popular, as is evidenced in the massive stone carvings of Buddhist deities in the mountains of Shaanxi and Henan provinces. Wooden pagodas, based on both the stupa of India and the towers of the Han dynasty, were an important architectural development of the period. The native belief systems of Confucianism and Taoism also fostered new subject matter and styles. The Confucian ideal was most popularly expressed in scenes of filial piety while Taoist artists favored landscapes and folk legends. Secular artistic traditions also underwent changes, particularly in the realm of painting. Gu Kaizhi, considered the father of Chinese landscape painting, was active during this period. Noteworthy advances in ceramics in southern China were also made, most notably in the green-glazed stoneware called Yueh-yao or \"Yueh ware,\" a durable ceramic that was eventually exported to places as distant as Egypt and the Philippines.

During Japanese aggression in China from 1937 to 1945, many woodcut artists followed Mao Zedong\u2019s idea of art as a political tool for mobilizing the working class and rural community. Although the nature and style of woodcuts transformed in this period, it is considered by some as the second phase of the Modern Woodcut Movement.

The dynasty was founded by the Mongol Kublai Khan (reigned 1260-1294), reuniting all of China into a empire that extended west as far as modern Poland and Hungary. While not great patrons of the arts, by reuniting China, expanding trade, and by not imposing stylistic demands, different traditions and influences were brought together and freely used. Innovations occurred particularly in the applied arts of porcelain and lacquer. During this time the Silk Route was reopened and Europe's interest in China began to develop. In response to foreign domination, educated Chinese withdrew into tradtions of their native past, with many scholars rejecting government service. The school of literati painting became dominant in the realm of painting, with artists emphasizing individual and calligraphic expression in contrast to the decorativeness of official painting. The most important Yuan masters were Huang Gongwang, Wu Zhen, Ni Zan, and Wang Meng, all of whom were literati objectors to Mongol rule. A noteworthy exception was Zhao Mengu, the most important Y\u00fcan calligrapher, who served the Mongols and was president of the Hanlin Academy. In the realm of ceramics, Middle Eastern influence stimulated exuberant blue-and-white decoration; Middle Eastern merchants also commissioned enormous Longquan celadons. Much Buddhist sculpture was commissioned during the Y\u00fcan period, with Tantric, multi-limbed figures revealing the Mongol preference for the lamaist art of Nepal and Tibet. The chiselling technique in silverwork, associated with the silversmith Zhu Bishan, developed at this time; Y\u00fcan carved lacquer was also produced.

Fatimid art is noteworthy for its internationalism: it bridges the east and west of the Islamic world and it was open to the Hellenic heritage of the Mediterranean and to some ideas from Christian powers to the north. Although Fatimid artists continued to use materials and techniques developed by the Tulunids, the abstraction favored by the Tulunids was replaced by an interest in exploring the tradition of figurative representation inherited from Iraq. Painting, book illustration, wood and ivory carving, and glass, ceramic and textile design bear figurative decoration unparalleled in contemporary Islamic art. An interest in naturalism is also evident. The iconography of Fatimid art is often indebted to Abbasid court art. Just as figural traditions were being developed, so were designs based on infinite systems of linear pattern; this form of ornamentation became one of the most successful forms of abstract Islamic art. Figural art was inappropriate for religious buildings, which were instead decorated with a vigorous new style of stone carving typically featuring elegant inscriptions in a distinctive form of kufic script elaborated with foliate and floral elements. A conch shell motif known from late antiquity was popular with the Fatimids, as seen on the fa\u00e7ade of the mosque of al-Akmar.

From 1090 the dynasty controlled Andalusia and it was through this connection that the Umayyad art of Spain was transplanted to North Africa. Egyptian influence was also felt. Known for their puritanical fervor, the Almoravids were mostly patrons of religious architecture. They built mosques in Tilimsen and Algiers that were inspired by the mosque at C\u00f3rdoba; other noteworthy mosques were built in F\u00e8s. Almoravid architects were known for their imaginative manipulation of three-dimensional space using ornamental arches and decorative vaults, architectural forms traditionally kept apart. These and other architectural forms animate their buildings instead of applied decoration. The hallmark of their distinctively Maghribi muqarnas is that the exterior reveals nothing of the internal configuration. The muqarnas vault at F\u00e8s is built over a rectangular space and so visually acts as a suspended ceiling rather than as a traditional dome.

This period is notable because it was the first time the whole Maghrib was united under one dynasty. The Almohads rose up against the Almoravids in 1121 and conquered Marrakesh in 1147. The dynasty declined in power when it was defeated by Alfonso VIII in 1212, losing Andalusia, and in 1269 when they lost Marrakesh to the Berber Marinids. The Almohad courts at Marrakesh and Seville were centers of Islamic art and learning, especially philosophy. Almohad architecture is known for its juxtaposition of puritanically simple design with ornate decoration. Enormous congregational mosques were built in Seville, Rabat and Marrakesh. Simple interiors are relieved by voluptuous, lobed arches and other details. Repetitive use of an architectural unit such as an arcade or bay to create directed vistas and a deep sense of space is another typical feature. Austere exteriors strongly contrast with the richly decorated, gigantic square minarets (late 12th century) of the three mosques. These minarets are elaborately fenestrated and each face has different latticed designs done in raised stonework. The mosque of Tinmal, with its characteristically Maghribi T-shape, is considered to be an Almohad masterpiece. The location of the minaret behind the mihrab is an important innovation at Tinmal. Almohad mosques tend to be enlarged at the expense of their courtyards. Other arts such as bookmaking, metalwork, and luxury textiles flourished as well. Several copies of the Koran reveal that paper began to replace parchment during this period. A binding on a magnificent multi-volume Koran (1256) is the earliest dated example of gold tooling.

From 1090 the dynasty controlled Andalusia and it was through this connection that the Umayyad art of Spain was transplanted to North Africa. Egyptian influence was also felt. Known for their puritanical fervor, the Almoravids were mostly patrons of religious architecture. They built mosques in Tilimsen and Algiers that were inspired by the mosque at C\u00f3rdoba; other noteworthy mosques were built in F\u00e8s. Almoravid architects were known for their imaginative manipulation of three-dimensional space using ornamental arches and decorative vaults, architectural forms traditionally kept apart. These and other architectural forms animate their buildings instead of applied decoration. The hallmark of their distinctively Maghribi muqarnas is that the exterior reveals nothing of the internal configuration. The muqarnas vault at F\u00e8s is built over a rectangular space and so visually acts as a suspended ceiling rather than as a traditional dome. A fountain that was once part of the Great Mosque of Marrakesh is noted for its lobed and crinkled arch forms that create a powerful sculptural rhythm."}], "mulatto": [], "mulattoes": [], "mulattos": [{"query_term": "mulattos", "aat_uri": "300198715", "found_in": "scopeNote", "prefLabel": "Creole (North American culture)", "prefLabel_comment": "", "altLabel": ["Cr\u00e9ole (North American culture)", "Criollo"], "altLabel_comment": [], "scopeNote": "In general, the term usually refers to a culture or style produced by people who were born in the Americas or nearby islands, but who were descended from colonists or slaves, as distinguished from people who arrived directly from Europe or Africa, or who were descended from aboriginal populations.

In animals they are visible in fats (e.g., butter), egg yolks, feathers (e.g., canary), and shells (e.g., lobster). These pigments are unsaturated hydrocarbons (having many double bonds), belonging to the isoprenoid series. Carotene occurs naturally in three isomeric forms, the most common being beta-carotene. As a colorant, it is sensitive to light and air; soluble in fats, oils and other substances, insoluble in water."}, {"query_term": "roots", "aat_uri": "300400868", "found_in": "scopeNote", "prefLabel": "Rubia cordifolia", "prefLabel_comment": "", "altLabel": ["common madder (species)", "munjeet (species)", "Bengal madder (species)", "Indian madder (species)", "manjistha (species)", "majith (species)", "tamaralli (species)", "manditti (species)"], "altLabel_comment": [], "scopeNote": "Species of evergreen flowering plant.

Buddhism, which came to China from neighboring India, had the most profound effect on Six Dynasties art; by the fourth century there was an established category of Chinese Buddhist art. The monastery at Dunhuang in western China preserves notable wall paintings. Monumental sculpture, a tradition brought to China from northern India, became popular, as is evidenced in the massive stone carvings of Buddhist deities in the mountains of Shaanxi and Henan provinces. Wooden pagodas, based on both the stupa of India and the towers of the Han dynasty, were an important architectural development of the period. The native belief systems of Confucianism and Taoism also fostered new subject matter and styles. The Confucian ideal was most popularly expressed in scenes of filial piety while Taoist artists favored landscapes and folk legends. Secular artistic traditions also underwent changes, particularly in the realm of painting. Gu Kaizhi, considered the father of Chinese landscape painting, was active during this period. Noteworthy advances in ceramics in southern China were also made, most notably in the green-glazed stoneware called Yueh-yao or \"Yueh ware,\" a durable ceramic that was eventually exported to places as distant as Egypt and the Philippines.

Another early practice was to raise a crucifix or a statue of the risen Christ through an opening in the church roof; this was sometimes accompanied by a figure of the devil made to descend at the same time. A distinctive feature of the Western liturgy of Ascension Day is the extinguishing of the Paschal candle after the Gospel has been read. The Paschal candle, which is first lit on Easter, is extinguished as a symbol of Christ's leaving the earth."}, {"query_term": "western", "aat_uri": "300018410", "found_in": "prefLabel", "prefLabel": "Western Wei (culture, style, and period)", "prefLabel_comment": "", "altLabel": ["Wei, Western (culture, style, and period)", "Western T'o-pa"], "altLabel_comment": [], "scopeNote": "Refers to the Chinese dynastic period, styles, and culture dating to 535 to 556 CE that was established by Yuwen Tai (reigned 535-551).

The population increased at this time and iron tools became more widespread, leading to agricultural advances. The rise of a merchant class and the development of coinage created a bigger market for artistic wares, of which bronzes remained the most important, becoming more secular and serving as symbols of status, wealth, and authority. Longer inscriptions are found on Zhou bronzes and are now valuable records of early Chinese history.

In accordance with Jewish law, Mary was purified and presented her son to God as her firstborn. In the Roman Catholic church the festival is currently called the Presentation of the Lord while the Anglican church calls it the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. Hypapante, the name for the festival in the Greek church, means 'meeting' and refers to the meeting of Jesus with Simeon and Anna in the Temple. The earliest reference to the festival comes from Jerusalem in the late 4th century. It quickly spread to other Eastern cities while it spread more slowly in the West. Justinian I decreed that it be observed on February 2 in 542. The festival was instituted in Rome probably before the time of Pope Sergius I (687-701) and the procession seems to have originated there, perhaps even before the feast itself was accepted. In the Western church it was mainly a celebration of the Virgin Mary (until the 1969 calendar reform) while in the Eastern church it was primarily a celebration of Christ. The name Candlemas comes from the tradition, in place by the mid-5th century, of observing the festival with candles.

In 1246, Robert de Torote, bishop of Li\u00e8ge, first celebrated the feast in his diocese after being persuaded to do so by Blessed Juliana, prioress of Mont Cornillon near Li\u00e8ge (1222-58), who had experienced a vision. The feast did not spread until Jacques Pantal\u00e9on, formerly archdeacon of Li\u00e8ge, became Pope Urban IV; a bull of 1264 commanded its observance. Over time it became more accepted and in the 15th century it became, in effect, the main feast of the church. Corpus Christi has been celebrated by carrying the host in procession since the 14th century. The feast's procession became a pageant in which sovereigns, princes, magistrates, and guild members took part. In the 15th century the procession was often followed by performances of miracle plays and mystery plays by members of guilds.

Easter evolved from the primitive Christian feast known as the Pasch of the 2nd and 3rd centuries; it was the Christian counterpart to the Jewish festival of Passover and it commemorated both Christ's death and Christ's resurrection. The paschal vigil is the main celebration of Easter in liturgical churches and is held on the night before; the paschal candle was introduced in about the 4th century. While the festival of Easter occurs on one particular Sunday, its importance is emphasized by the long preparation of Lent, by the solemn services of Holy Week, and by the following fifty days until Pentecost, a period known as Eastertide or Paschaltide.

The ruined city of Samarra, occupied by the Abbasids in the 9th century, is a prime example of this influence, especially in the Sassanian construction methods. Samarra is noted for its ornamental stucco, particularly the so-called 'bevelled' manner of decoration derived from Scythian-Siberian abstract design. Highly valued Chinese porcelain was imitated by potters of the period; the results were distinctly Islamic, however, with Arabic inscriptions and designs. Abbasid textiles also assumed an identifiable Islamic character. The vast empire became unwieldy and as its central administration weakened, rival caliphates were established. Although the Abbasids continued to rule part of the Islamic world until 1258, their dominance only lasted until the mid-10th century."}, {"query_term": "oriental", "aat_uri": "300019396", "found_in": "scopeNote", "prefLabel": "Early Style", "prefLabel_comment": "", "altLabel": [], "altLabel_comment": [], "scopeNote": "Refers to the first of four divisions of La T\u00e8ne art as defined by Paul Jacobsthal's in 1944.

Genetic evidence suggests that the domestic cat developed from an ancestor who also produced the subspecies of wild cat, Felis sylvestris lybica. The house cat appears to have been domesticated in the Middle East at a time when humans recognized its value in protecting fields and granaries from rodents. Egyptian affection and respect for the cat as predator led to the development of religious cat cults and temple worship of cats. Since tabby-like markings appear in the drawings and mummies of ancient Egyptian cats, present-day tabbies probably look much like the sacred cats of Egypt. The first known domestic variation on the wild tabby coloring was the black cat (which also occurs naturally in the wild, but not in great numbers). The darker tabby coat with thicker stripes and swirls probably first appeared in the Middle Ages, the coat pattern being an adaptation that helped the animal to hide better in the shadows of dark medieval streets. The tortoise shell coat probably developed in the 19th century, when the Victorians made cats beloved pets and bred them for color varieties and other characteristics.

The pieces include a king (general), mandarins, rooks (chariots), knights (horses), elephants (bishops or ministers), cannons, and pawns (soldiers)."}, {"query_term": "black", "aat_uri": "300198915", "found_in": "scopeNote", "prefLabel": "little master cups", "prefLabel_comment": "", "altLabel": ["little master cup", "cups, little master", "little-master cups", "Little Master cups", "Little Masters cups", "Little-Master cup"], "altLabel_comment": [], "scopeNote": "Black-figure kylikes characterized by miniature decoration; generally of the 7th and early 6th centuries BCE.

Although water deer resemble extinct primitive deer in lacking antlers, they evolved from ancestors with antlers that were subsequently lost. Their morphology indicates that they are New World deer. Males stand about 50 cm (20 inches) tall at the shoulder and weigh up to 13 kg (29 pounds); females weigh up to 11 kg (24 pounds). They have a rather uniformly colored coat, yellowish brown above and yellowish white below. The tail is very short, and there is no rump patch.

Easter evolved from the primitive Christian feast known as the Pasch of the 2nd and 3rd centuries; it was the Christian counterpart to the Jewish festival of Passover and it commemorated both Christ's death and Christ's resurrection. The paschal vigil is the main celebration of Easter in liturgical churches and is held on the night before; the paschal candle was introduced in about the 4th century. While the festival of Easter occurs on one particular Sunday, its importance is emphasized by the long preparation of Lent, by the solemn services of Holy Week, and by the following fifty days until Pentecost, a period known as Eastertide or Paschaltide.

Many aspects of Bon were mixed with the Buddhist traditions introduced from India in the 8th century and gave Tibetan Buddhism much of its distinctiveness. Disagreement amongst the ruling class of Tibet in the 8th and 9th centuries resulted in the noble families choosing Bon and the ruling house choosing Buddhism. The religion became organized around the 11th century largely thanks to the Buddhist concern for written works. Besides surviving in many aspects of Tibetan Buddhism, Bon continues to thrive in the northern and eastern frontiers of Tibet. It is unclear how much continuity there is between ancient and modern Bon. The features of ancient Bon are hard to determine because all early description are Buddhist and what is known of Bon today is heavily influenced by Mahayana Buddhism. Ancient Bon seems to have featured animism, shamanism, and the practice of magic rites. The Bon gods of the atmosphere, the earth, and subterranean regions were incorporated into the Buddhist pantheon as lesser deities. There is evidence of a cult of divine kingship in which the kings are seen as manifestations of the sky divinity; this belief may be the root of the reincarnated lamas of Buddhism. Bon oracular priests have as their counterpart the Buddhist soothsayers. Aspects of Bon doctrine are virtually identical to that of Tibetan Buddhism, including doctrine of buddhahood and the bodhisattva ideal. Particularly noteworthy are the dzogchen beliefs of Bon that are shared with the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism; these beliefs hold that there is an ineffable state beyond all Buddhas and all manifestation. The Bon monastic system is also almost identical to that of the Geluk school. Nevertheless, believers in Bon rigorously guard their non-Buddhist image. Shenrab is considered the founder of the religion and the historical Buddha Shakyamuni is said to be a manifestation of him.

After Suun was executed by the government, his successors Ch'oe Si-hyong and Son Piyong-hi fostered the movement until it grew to become a major Korean religion. The Chondogyo scriptures are the writings of the three founders. The religion views humans as bearers of divinity and as such, humans must treat one another 'as God.' Chondogyo stresses the universality of God and calls for a cooperative kingdom of God on earth based on faith, simplicity, steadfastness, and sincerity. There is no concept of eternal reward because the religion's aim is solely to bring righteousness and peace to the world. There are five recommended practices: chanting of a formula every night at nine o'clock; the use of water as a symbol of purity; attending a Sunday worship service; offering rice to the church on a regular basis; and praying in different ways.
