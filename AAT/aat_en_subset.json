A unified style of art developed, inspired by ancient Persia rather than Christian Syria. The ruined city of Samarra, occupied by the Abbasids in the 9th century, is a prime example of this influence, especially in the Sassanian construction methods. Samarra is noted for its ornamental stucco, particularly the so-called 'bevelled' manner of decoration derived from Scythian-Siberian abstract design. Highly valued Chinese porcelain was imitated by potters of the period; the results were distinctly Islamic, however, with Arabic inscriptions and designs. Abbasid textiles also assumed an identifiable Islamic character. The vast empire became unwieldy and as its central administration weakened, rival caliphates were established.
