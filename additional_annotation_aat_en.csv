8,berber,300114633,Almoravid,['Almoravides'],"Refers to the art and culture associated with the Islamic Berber dynasty that ruled in Spain and North Africa from 1054 to 1147, when it was succeeded by the Almohad dynasty. The Almoravids developed out of a puritanical movement in western Africa that appealed to North African Berbers. The Almoravid leader Yusuf b. Tashfin founded Marrakesh in 1069. From 1090 the dynasty controlled Andalusia and it was through this connection that the Umayyad art of Spain was transplanted to North Africa. Egyptian influence was also felt. Known for their puritanical fervor, the Almoravids were mostly patrons of religious architecture. They built mosques in Tilimsen and Algiers that were inspired by the mosque at Córdoba; other noteworthy mosques were built in Fès. Almoravid architects were known for their imaginative manipulation of three-dimensional space using ornamental arches and decorative vaults, architectural forms traditionally kept apart. These and other architectural forms animate their buildings instead of applied decoration. The hallmark of their distinctively Maghribi muqarnas is that the exterior reveals nothing of the internal configuration. The muqarnas vault at Fès is built over a rectangular space and so visually acts as a suspended ceiling rather than as a traditional dome. A fountain that was once part of the Great Mosque of Marrakesh is noted for its lobed and crinkled arch forms that create a powerful sculptural rhythm.",,[]
9,berber,300021550,Fatimid,[],"Refers to the art and culture associated with the Islamic Berber dynasty of this name that ruled in Ifriqiya (modern Tunisia) from 909 to 972 and in Egypt from 969 to 1171. The Fatimids, of the Shi'a sect, traced their ancestry back to Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad. The Fatimids had many rivals to contend with as well as the challenge of the Crusaders. Fatimid art is noteworthy for its internationalism: it bridges the east and west of the Islamic world and it was open to the Hellenic heritage of the Mediterranean and to some ideas from Christian powers to the north. Although Fatimid artists continued to use materials and techniques developed by the Tulunids, the abstraction favored by the Tulunids was replaced by an interest in exploring the tradition of figurative representation inherited from Iraq. Painting, book illustration, wood and ivory carving, and glass, ceramic and textile design bear figurative decoration unparalleled in contemporary Islamic art. An interest in naturalism is also evident. The iconography of Fatimid art is often indebted to Abbasid court art. Just as figural traditions were being developed, so were designs based on infinite systems of linear pattern; this form of ornamentation became one of the most successful forms of abstract Islamic art. Figural art was inappropriate for religious buildings, which were instead decorated with a vigorous new style of stone carving typically featuring elegant inscriptions in a distinctive form of kufic script elaborated with foliate and floral elements. A conch shell motif known from late antiquity was popular with the Fatimids, as seen on the façade of the mosque of al-Akmar. Nothing has survived of the two Fatimid palaces that stood in the center of Cairo but accounts of them attest to their magnificence.",,[]

15,berber,300021528,Almohad,"['Almohades', 'al-Muwahhidun']","Refers to the art and culture associated with the Islamic Berber dynasty that ruled in North Africa and southern Spain (1130-1269). This period is notable because it was the first time the whole Maghrib was united under one dynasty. The Almohads rose up against the Almoravids in 1121 and conquered Marrakesh in 1147. The dynasty declined in power when it was defeated by Alfonso VIII in 1212, losing Andalusia, and in 1269 when they lost Marrakesh to the Berber Marinids. The Almohad courts at Marrakesh and Seville were centers of Islamic art and learning, especially philosophy. Almohad architecture is known for its juxtaposition of puritanically simple design with ornate decoration. Enormous congregational mosques were built in Seville, Rabat and Marrakesh. Simple interiors are relieved by voluptuous, lobed arches and other details. Repetitive use of an architectural unit such as an arcade or bay to create directed vistas and a deep sense of space is another typical feature. Austere exteriors strongly contrast with the richly decorated, gigantic square minarets (late 12th century) of the three mosques. These minarets are elaborately fenestrated and each face has different latticed designs done in raised stonework. The mosque of Tinmal, with its characteristically Maghribi T-shape, is considered to be an Almohad masterpiece. The location of the minaret behind the mihrab is an important innovation at Tinmal. Almohad mosques tend to be enlarged at the expense of their courtyards. Other arts such as bookmaking, metalwork, and luxury textiles flourished as well. Several copies of the Koran reveal that paper began to replace parchment during this period. A binding on a magnificent multi-volume Koran (1256) is the earliest dated example of gold tooling. Textiles, like bookbindings, show a taste for geometric patterns.",,[]

Differences include pottery with close parallels to the ancient Greek world, the use of an Aegean instead of a Semitic script, and the consumption of pork. The style of art is characterized by a combination of Aegean, Canaanite, and Egyptian elements, seen particularly in cermaics and metalwork. They may have originated in Crete. It is generally agreed by modern scholars that the Philistines were the same as the ""Peleset"" of historical records. They may also be the ""Sea Peoples,"" or at least one of the tribes so-called.

154,tribes,300438770,Qatapan,['獵首祭'],"Qatapan used to be the celebratory singing and dancing after satapan (“head hunting”). Over the years its religious significance takes up a festive and performative turn. Qatapan is now regularly put on show in tribes, local chapels, Kavalan societies, campaign gatherings and national concert halls. Upon their return, the head-hunters dressed in straw cape and with a walking stick hang the heads on a long rod, circled by warriors and seniors chanting spaw and toasting. Legend has it that it will rain after the chanting to purge the people. The Japanese rule severely proscribed the Kavalan’s head hunting and the ritual was thus suspended. By the 1970s the nature of Qatapan shifted significantly as the Kavalan people tend to organize harvest festival together with the Amis as their long-established matrimonial kin. Even if the festival bears the same name, the head hunting hymn of spaw is no longer sung. With the campaign for recognition in the 1908s, the revival of the traditional ritual took up the form of circular dancing around a type of tree called Palaquium formosanum, and one of the hymns known as miomio has been adapted with modified lyrics as a precious cultural heritage constituent of the Kavalan identity.",,[]

The second phase takes place in the following year, in which ceremonies are held to bid farewell to evil spirits and ancestral spirits. Different tribes tend to interpret the origin of Maljeveq differently, while there are a number of objectives central to the festival: praying to ancestral spirits for good fortune, expressing sentiments that people hold dear to their life, holding the tribe together and reallocating positive augury among families.",,[]

The largest of the sects is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Mormons believe that in 1822 the angel Moroni led Smith to gold tablets buried in 438 CE on a hill near Palmyra, New York. These tablets were inscribed with the Book of Mormon, which Smith translated. The Book of Mormon is an account of certain tribes of Israel that migrated to America before the birth of Christ; it also tells of a post-resurrection appearance of Christ in America. The authenticity of the texts has been questioned for a number of reasons, but it is not disputed by Mormons. Mormon doctrine is also derived from the King James Version of the Bible although Mormonism is very divergent from Christian doctrine. Perhaps most notably, Mormonism holds that the Trinity is three distinct beings. Mormons believe that Christian churches have apostasized but true Christianity has been restored by Smith. Mormonism contends that spiritual perfection or godhood can be attained through a process of spiritual evolution and daily practical guidance. Entry to Christ's kingdom is attained through repentance and baptism by immersion. Mormons believe in the coming of a millennium when Christ will rule from Jerusalem and Independence, Missouri. Mormonism is often associated with ideas such as collective ownership, tithing, polygamy (later abandoned), strong conformity, heavy church activism, and proselytization.",,[]
159,western,300417408,Nativist Art,[],"An art movement that prevailed in Taiwan in the 1970s, roughly concurrent with the Nativist Movement in literature and other spheres that reflected on Taiwan’s local identity in the face of political crisis and rapid industrialization. Under the influence of publications such as Lion Art, many artists shifted their fascination with Western modern art in the previous decade to the local and the traditional. Four trends can be identified within the multifaceted movement. First, the naive style of suren artists (artists without formal training) such as Hung T’ung and Ju Ming earned high esteem. Second, typical scenes and objects of Taiwan became popular subjects, usually depicted in Nostalgic Realist or Super-realist style. Third, major artists from the period of the Japanese rule regained attention and recognition. Finally, there was a surge in the study of folk art and a growing concern about preserving traditional architecture and other forms of heritage. The movement marked a major shift in Taiwanese modern art history and is thought to have played a significant role in the formation of Taiwanese identity.",,[]
160,western,300264898,Six Dynasties,"['Dynasties, Six', 'Six Dynasties Chinese', 'Southern Dynasties']","Refers to a period of four centuries in southern Chinese history after the overthrow of the Han dynasty in 220 CE and before the Sui dynasty (ca.  589 CE). During this time, rival clans tried to control portions of the Han empire. Chinese art was influenced during this time by new ideas, especially religious developments. Buddhism, which came to China from neighboring India, had the most profound effect on Six Dynasties art; by the fourth century there was an established category of Chinese Buddhist art. The monastery at Dunhuang in western China preserves notable wall paintings. Monumental sculpture, a tradition brought to China from northern India, became popular, as is evidenced in the massive stone carvings of Buddhist deities in the mountains of Shaanxi and Henan provinces. Wooden pagodas, based on both the stupa of India and the towers of the Han dynasty, were an important architectural development of the period. The native belief systems of Confucianism and Taoism also fostered new subject matter and styles. The Confucian ideal was most popularly expressed in scenes of filial piety while Taoist artists favored landscapes and folk legends. Secular artistic traditions also underwent changes, particularly in the realm of painting. Gu Kaizhi, considered the father of Chinese landscape painting, was active during this period. Noteworthy advances in ceramics in southern China were also made, most notably in the green-glazed stoneware called Yueh-yao or ""Yueh ware,"" a durable ceramic that was eventually exported to places as distant as Egypt and the Philippines. It was during this period that gentlemen-painters and calligraphers and great private art collections first emerged in China. Literary and art criticism also developed. ",,[]

The Zhou dynasty succeeded the Shang dynasty. The area ruled by the Zhous was very large but their rule was not direct and so was often challenged. The Zhou period is divided into the Western Zhou (ca. 1050-771 BCE) and the Eastern Zhou (771-256 BCE). There was a great deal of regional diversity in the Zhou period, but overall it was a time of noteworthy political, philosophical, religious, and social changes. Many basic Chinese traditions were established and the earliest Chinese literature dates from the Zhou period, including the writing of Confucius. The population increased at this time and iron tools became more widespread, leading to agricultural advances. The rise of a merchant class and the development of coinage created a bigger market for artistic wares, of which bronzes remained the most important, becoming more secular and serving as symbols of status, wealth, and authority. Longer inscriptions are found on Zhou bronzes and are now valuable records of early Chinese history. The decoration of bronzes became more abstract, geometric, and colorful with an increased use of relief and precious inlay. The many small states of the Zhou dynasty became virtually independent of central authority and it was the Qin who eventually defeated the other states to establish the first unified Chinese rule.",,[]

The order was prominent during the Middle Ages, particularly under the leadership of St. Bernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153), with over 500 houses in Europe by the 13th century, but declined thereafter. The Cistercian's emphasis on manual labor, particularly farm labor, meant that the order played an important role in the economic progress of the 12th century and in the development of farming and marketing techniques. Reform movements occurred during the 16th and 17th centuries and the order ultimately divided into the Order of the Reformed Cistercians of the Strict Observance (often popularly called the Trappists) and the Cistercians of Common Observance. Today, there is a great amount of diversity among the monasteries of both orders and there has been a revival of literary work in both. Strict Observance is active in France, England and Poland while Common Observance is active in the United States and parts of Western Europe. ",,[]

Realism in this case refers to how these artists used their subjective, internal vision of reality to create works of art. Neo-Realism was formed as a reaction to the perceived academic and sentimental status of art in the previous generation. In a sense it was a seminally representational style that was more open to various degrees of abstraction opened up through increasing familiarity with western modern art movements.

It seems to have begun in the 16th century, and in its first phase retained a hieratic and abstract quality. The subject matter is essentially Hindu, with particular attention to the life of Krishna. The literature and painting of the time were products of the contemporary religious development that emphasized devotion to Krishna as the way to salvation. Popular themes were pictorial representations of the musical modes (ragamala) and of love poetry. The style was not much influenced by Mughal painting styles until the eighteenth century when the sharp distinction between the two styles became more obscured.

China flourished as a stable, consolidated empire and the resulting prosperity and patronage created a Golden Age of Chinese painting, metalwork, ceramics, music, and poetry. Chang'an, with its masterful urban planning, remained the main Tang capital and a world center. Taizong (reigned 626-649) and Xuanzong (reigned 712-756) were important Tang rulers and patrons. Buddhism remained influential although it suffered periods of persecution during the Tang dynasty. Paintings from the caves at Dunhuang and stone pagodas such as the Great Wild Goose Pagoda (ca. 652) and the Small Wild Goose Pagoda (ca. 707) in Chang'an have survived. Monumental stone sculpture of the northern provinces displays the new tendency toward fuller, more sensual figures. This tendency also found in secular Tang sculpture, both stone and ceramic. The merging of Indian and Chinese sculpture styles is seen at the cave at Mt. Tianlong, created under the patronage of Empress Wu Zetian (reigned 690-705). Painting, which flourished during the Tang, was dominated by the secular landscape tradition. Li Sixum and Li Zhaodao, father and son, and Wang Wei are three painters' names known to us; probable copies of their work exist. Wang Wei's work, influential for later artists, was intimate and melancholy while the work of Li Sixum and Li Zhaodao features the bright greens and blues of many Tang landscapes. Chinese portrait painting, begun in the Han dynasty, was refined in the Tang by such artists as Wu Daozi. Tang ceramics include sancai earthenware figurines and vessels, typically used as tomb objects, white porcellanous wares such as the well-known Xing ware of Henan province, and the jadelike Yue celadons of Zhejiang province. The use of metal oxides in underglaze decoration was developed in Hunan and Sichuanh provinces and porcelain, although not fully exploited until later, has its origins in the Tang period. Tang decorative arts were influenced by Middle Eastern and other foreign trends during the Tang dynasty, leading to new styles in ceramics and metalwork. For instance, colorful glazed earthenware objects such as ewers and rhytons were made to resemble Persian silverwork and Persian weft patterning were introduced to Chinese textiles. China, in turn, exported its pottery, silk, and printing and paper technology. The Tang dynasty was succeeded by the Later Liang dynasty.",,[]
