Buddhist art flourished under state and private patronage during most of this period. Cave temples at Yungang were begun in ca. 460; thousands of craftsmen worked for about 35 years to make the temples and adorn them with sculpture and painting. Other cave temples were later made at Longmen at the instigation of Xiaowendi. While Yungang features static icons in a Gandharan style, the sculpture at Longmen is more linear, demonstrating the emerging Chinese style. Northern Wei burial pottery, also influenced by Buddhism, emphasizes frontality and symmetry. The nomadic Touba people began to rely on Chinese institutions to organize and run their state and they also became accustomed to Chinese culture and luxuries; under Xiaowendi Chinese became the official language and the use of Tuoba language was forbidden. The distinction between the 'barbarian' north and 'civilized' south became less marked; nevertheless, northern frontiersmen began to feel neglected and so they revolted, leading to the collapse of the Northern Wei dynasty.

The Almoravids developed out of a puritanical movement in western Africa that appealed to North African Berbers. The Almoravid leader Yusuf b. Tashfin founded Marrakesh in 1069. From 1090 the dynasty controlled Andalusia and it was through this connection that the Umayyad art of Spain was transplanted to North Africa. Egyptian influence was also felt. Known for their puritanical fervor, the Almoravids were mostly patrons of religious architecture. They built mosques in Tilimsen and Algiers that were inspired by the mosque at Córdoba; other noteworthy mosques were built in Fès. Almoravid architects were known for their imaginative manipulation of three-dimensional space using ornamental arches and decorative vaults, architectural forms traditionally kept apart. These and other architectural forms animate their buildings instead of applied decoration. The hallmark of their distinctively Maghribi muqarnas is that the exterior reveals nothing of the internal configuration. The muqarnas vault at Fès is built over a rectangular space and so visually acts as a suspended ceiling rather than as a traditional dome.

The animal nature of sponges was first described in 1755, and was confirmed in 1765 after observations revealed movement of their openings. In structure, function, and development, however, sponges are distinct from other animals. Many zoologists regard sponges as occupying an isolated position in the animal kingdom and classify them in the subkingdom Parazoa. Other sources consider sponges relatives of the invertebrate animal group coelenterates. Aquatic, chiefly marine animals of the phylum Porifera, varying greatly in size, shape, and color, and having a porous body and siliceous or calcareous internal framework, living permanently attached singly or in groups, feeding b filtering food particles from the water that enters their internal body channels through their pores. They are very simply organized with no mouth, digestive cavity, nerves, muscle, or true behavior, and sometimes are considered to be colonized protozoans rather than single multicellular organisms. For the light, porous, yielding fibrous skeletal matter of these animals, use ""sponge (material).""",,[]

It was given definitive form in the 16th century in Anatolia (Turkey) by Bālim Sulṭān. While originally a Sufi order within Orthodox Sunnite Islam, during this period it became more syncretic and adopted tenets of the Shi'a sect. Aspects of Christianity such as confession, absolution and initiation practices were also incorporated as a result of contact with Christians. Bektashi is Shi'a in that it recognizes the twelve imāms (spiritual leaders) and venerates Ali but it is different from most other Muslim orders in that it regards traditional Islamic rituals as hypocrisy and, like many Sufi orders, is lax about observing daily Muslim laws. Bektashi allows women to take part in rituals without wearing a veil. Bektashi mystical writings are an important contribution to Sufi poetry. Through its connection with the Janissaries, an elite Ottoman military corp recruited from Christian areas, Bektashi maintained political importance from the 15th century until shortly after 1826 when the Janissaries were disbanded. The Bektashi order was dissolved in Turkey in 1925 along with all other Sufi orders but it survived in Albania until religion was banned there in 1967. It is still found in some communities in Turkey, Albanian regions of the Balkans, and the United States. Followers wear white caps with 4 or 12 folds, the 4 representing the 4 gates of Islam and the 12 representing the 12 imāms.",,[]
