	dcterms:description "The term “Aboriginal” stems from the Latin words ab and origine, meaning “from the beginning”, and is a commonly used word, including in museum databases. “Aboriginal” describes the original inhabitants of a place and is primarily used to refer to Indigenous peoples in Australia and Canada (see also “Indigenous”). However, in Canada, there has been a recent preference for the use of Indigenous. The term does not adequately describe the complexity and diversity of Indigenous peoples. Many Indigenous peoples in both countries do not like to be referred to as “Aboriginal”, preferring to emphasize other markers of their identity such as language, land and clan relationships. In Canada the term came into general use in the 1980s, when a legal and overarching term was sought to collectively describe the existing—but controversial—categories “Indian,” “Inuit” and “Métis” (see also “Indian” and “Eskimo”)."@en ;

The term, which literally means “from another soil/location” (antonym autochtoon) was introduced as an identity category in the Netherlands in the 1970s to replace “immigrant,” which by that time had started to develop negative connotations. While the term itself was intended to be generic and to describe anyone born outside or with one parent born outside the Netherlands, it was split into the subcategories of Western and non-Western, thus creating a distinction between different categories of outsiders. The term has increasingly been used as a stand-in for people who appear to be visibly different, i.e. non-White people. “Allochtoon” has lost favor with some, including policy makers and the public alike, with some municipalities deciding no longer to use the term."@en ;

In Britain the term is used similarly; however it has also been used as a socio-political identity category to unite diverse non-White groups of people, regardless of their ethnic or geographical origins, who had suffered racism. This usage is less common in the Netherlands. In the US, the term primarily describes African Americans; “people of color” is also used as a political identity category that includes all non-White people.

The renaming of places is a common occurrence, both historically and in the present, often resulting from different political shifts over time. This was an important ideological practice, both during the colonial period and during decolonization. This practice continues today. On claiming territory, colonizers named cities and towns after important people or after their own places. Renaming—either restoring earlier names or creating new names— was an important practice for newly formed nations in the decolonization process. The use of names that were assigned under colonization can be painful for some, as a legacy of colonialism. The city of Mumbai continued to be called Bombay until long after independence but was officially changed in 1995. Calcutta (now Kolkata) and Chennai (Madras) are similar colonial toponyms that were Anglicized during the colonial period. Other contested colonial toponyms include: Jakarta (formerly Batavia), Myanmar (formerly Burma) and Zimbabwe (Southern Rhodesia)."@en ;

#Colored

	dcterms:title "Colored"@en ;
	dcterms:description "“Colored” is a controversial term normally used to describe a person or a group of people with mixed White European and non-White, for example, someone of African or Asian, ancestry. In some cases the term is also used to describe a Black person. The term has different histories of use and meanings within different parts of the world, but is generally regarded as derogatory today. Within South Africa, for example, the term describes someone of mixed ancestry, including Khoisan, Malay, and White. Within the USA the term was used historically to refer primarily to a Black person or the Black community, and is more restrictive than the similar term “person(s)/people of color”. In the Netherlands, the term is used similarly to describe a Black person, or someone of mixed ancestry, with several interrelated Dutch language terms for these identity categories such as: colored (gekleurd), having a bit of color (met een kleurtje) or with a darker skin colour (met een donkerdere huidskleur). The use of these terms harkens back to a racialised idea of whiteness as the norm. These different Dutch terms are all increasingly regarded as inappropriate and derogatory. There is growing acceptance by many for the use of the American identity category “person(s) of color” or “people of color”, abbreviated POC. There is also the more recently emerging group category to more broadly describe non-White people, which is “Black and Non-Black People of Color”. While the terms “Black”, and “person(s) of color” remain generally acceptable terms for many, using the terms that the persons themselves find respectful and acceptable is advised."@en ;

Activists argued that a disability was not an individual problem to solve, but a social construct that made living with an impairment into a problem.

Like the racial sciences from which the term emerged, it suggests an incommensurability between two so-regarded different species of mankind. Like the mule, then, this results in an abnormal offspring, presumed infertile. Mulattos were deemed to represent the “horrors” of miscegenation (see also “Half-blood”), but because of their so-called White blood they were believed to be more intelligent—and often more attractive—than Black people.

In racial thinking the color of one’s skin is regarded as a sign of incommensurable difference between groups, including a hierarchy in aptitude, abilities, even behavior and development. According to 18th- and 19th-century racial sciences, humans were divided into different groups, arranged hierarchically. These typologies reinforced colonial ideologies of difference, with the White European at the top of a racial hierarchy (see also “Caucasian” and “Negro”). While race is not a biological fact, it has social consequences, for example in discrimination, prejudice and inequality.

These interrelated terms describe a person employed in another’s household to do diverse domestic duties such as cooking and cleaning, or to be someone’s attendant. The terms do not in themselves suppose gross exploitation, even if they describe a hierarchical relation in class and power, sometimes marked by exploitation. The multiple and complex relations that servants may have with their masters makes any too easy judgement of the role of the servant or conditions under which they lived an incautious one. “Page” describes a young male servant or attendant, working for a nobleman, or from the Renaissance as servants for fashionable women and men. Referring to someone as servant or page today is regarded as demeaning or insulting in some circles. Maintaining the term in the description of historic paintings and photographs may however be recommended in some situations, especially when the person’s name is not known, since it conveys the power relations more transparently."@en ;

In the 6th century, for example, “sklabos” (Greek) meant an un-free person of Slavic descent, while in medieval Latin “sclavus” more generally meant “a person who is owned by another.” Today, the term is more generally used to describe people from Africa who were bought/captured and enslaved by Europeans and forced to work on plantations, often under inhumane conditions, within European colonial projects. Increasingly “slave” has become contested by activists, scholars and the public alike, as it is argued that using the term is to normalize the category “slave” as an inherent identity of a person, thus ignoring that this identity was created not by choice but through violent force. The term also denies the humanity of the person, reducing them to being no more than the property of another.

	dcterms:title "White"@en ;
	dcterms:description "This term has long been used to describe a racial identity, based on skin color, and usually describes certain groups of Europeans and their emigrant population across the world. The term is associated with the racial sciences of the 18th and 19th centuries. As an ideological category associated for example with Europe’s imperial expansion, White has come to connote progress, sophistication or cultured. Since the latter part of the 20th century there has been sustained critique of the social construction of Whiteness as norm, arguing that it is an identity category that emerged to justify or reinforce discrimination against non-White people. Within the Netherlands, in addition to increasing critique of Whiteness are discussions about whether one should use the word Wit or Blank as descriptor (see also “Blank”)."@en ;
